# Menuets application startup script

# This file lists the applications that are started automatically on power up.
# Blank lines, or lines beginning with # are ignored - they are comments.

# The format for each line is:
# APPLICATIONNAME PARAMETER DELAY
# 
# applicationname is the filename of the application, in uppercase
# parameter is the string passed to the application - normally boot,
# although programs like tinypad expect a filename instead. This string can be
# up to 64 characters in length.
# delay is the starup delay for the application in ms ( 1000 = 1 second )
# This is to give some applications time to startup before the next is called.
# 2000 is the recommended default.

# You may specify up to 50 applications in this file!


# If you like the old background image, you can uncomment this line,
# and comment out the JPEGVIEW one.
#PIC4 BOOT 2000

JPEGVIEW BOOT 2000

#PANEL BOOT 2000

ICONMNGR BOOT 2000

# This line opens tinypad and loads this file.
# Not very useful, but it demonstrates other parameter options
